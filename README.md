# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for this project is DriverPass and the owner, Liam, would like to create a cloud-based system that provides online courses and tests for driving, and aids in scheduling on-road training that can be accessed from anywhere on any device.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe I completed detailed documents that captured the requirements Liam asked for. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my UML diagrams. I would like to add more details and correct a few things I noticed were wrong after submitting Project Two.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider developing a software that is user friendly and is easy to navigate. If you do not consider the user's needs when designing, the system is 
not going to achieve the wanted results. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I like to read over the interview transcript as many times as possible for a refresher and to ensure I covered the client's needs. In the future, I would certainly need to 
have notes on what the client wants to ensure I will meet the client's needs.
